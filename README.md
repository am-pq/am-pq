- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Michael Paquette (@am-pq). 
- [Most of these are programming assignments for my university education, and thus I cannot post code by university policy. See the list of future projects for code I would like to work on and post, when I get a spare moment.]



List of past projects (reverse chronology):

- Speech Analyser (Python) - made alone. processes speech .wav files via FFT to extract formant data. This produces input variables required for a parametric speech synthesizer (parametric as opposed to the ML models Siri and similar software operates via -- parametric = more linguistic theory, less raw data).

- OpenGL Implementation (C++) - made alone. Inputs, outputs, camera movement, model rendering, lighting, etc. Not very hard after the animation class (listed below).

- Mathematical modelling of alberta wildfire data (Java, SQL) - team of 5. Pattern extraction. Mostly learned that I struggle with ML due to (at the time) lack of statistical background. Since remedied.

- Android app, Kijiji-like, titled "Whale Borrow" - team of 5. Connects users and their listed objects -- thus, a lot of network code, as well as the android APK handling code. I contributed the 2nd most out of 5 team members, mostly on the data structure / program architecture side.
  
- 5 minute 3D animation, titled "The Paris Site" - made on team of 3, listed here because I did a lot of lighting + ray-tracing + procedural generation code for it, and I honestly did not do much actual animation. Science fiction, set in paris. I abdure responsibility for its title.
  
- 30 minute computer game, titled "Hotel Menzrai" (Neverwinter Nights engine) - made on team of 4, I was team lead + music + writing + junior programming. Pacifist walking simulator game exploring themes of memory and trauma. Won the "Best CMPUT 250 Story of the year" award, an accolade I certainly did not deserve.

[Work-In-Progress: I intend to add some images of the programs in action, as I am very proud of the aesthetic of many of these.]

List of future projects (in planning / research phase):

- An alternate firmware for Temps_Utile eurorack module: there exists a synthesizer called an "Ornament and Crime" which serves various functions, and the "Temps_Utile" is its less successful younger sibling, with mostly digital-exclusive outputs (in contrast to the O_C's analog outputs). I plan to code a set of real-time DSP logic functions to run on these digital outputs. I know how to do this, and it will just take some time.
- A searchable index for the texts of Jacques Lacan - I need more Natural Language Processing education for this, and thus it is further out, but I would like to build a searchable index for JL and some of my favorite other too-prolific authors (maybe Soren Kierkegaard).
