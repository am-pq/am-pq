- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Paquette (@am-pq)

A summary of my academic history (uAlberta) by division into three categories:

*Courses I found success in, with ease. Consider these my list of loved topics.*

  C programming
  Game design
  Linear Algebra
  Speech Synthesis
  Calculus (SingleVariable and MultiVariable)
  Numerical Methods
  Higher Algebra
  Mathematical Modelling
  Probability
  Graph Theory
  Technical Communication

*Courses I found success in, with difficulty.*

  Algorithms w Java
  Graphics (openGL)
  Calculus (Differential Equations)
  Mathematical Finance

*Courses I struggled with. Consider these my weaknesses.*

  Statistics
  Machine Learning
  Assembly and Architecture w RISC
  
*Future Prospects*
 
  My next learning project, by sheer interest, is not through my Alma Mater. Just in my spare time, I aim to learn, via MIT's OCW resources, their 3 course sequence on Circuits, Signals, and Systems.
